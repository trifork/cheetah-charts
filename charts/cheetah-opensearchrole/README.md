![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for creating opensearch roles with both read and write permissions based on a given index name.

## Introduction

This is to support the OAuth2 security model and helps scaffold the nessesary roles for the OpenSearch cluster that is mapped from the role claims in the JWT token.

## Role Definitions

The chart creates two OpensearchUserRoleBinding and OpensearchRole resources:

1. A OpenSearch role with read permissions (`roleNamePrefix_roleName_read`).
2. A OpenSearch role with write permissions (`roleNamePrefix_roleName_write`).

Each role has cluster permissions for node sniffing, health monitoring, and index and template discovery.

## Example

```sh
# JWT claim
{
    "osroles": [
        "opensearch_myindex_read"
    ]
}
```

Works together with the HelmRelease:

```yaml
apiVersion: helm.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: opensearch-role-obiscode
  ...
spec:
  releaseName: opensearch-role-myindex
  chart:
    ...
  values:
    roleName: myindex
    indexPattern: myindex*

```

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| roleNamePrefix | string | `"opensearch_"` | prefix to be added to the role name.  |
| roleName | string | `"my-role-name"` | name of the role to be created and mapped from the claims in the JWT token. Will create 2 roles, with a _read and _write suffix.  Usually matches index name without wildcards. |
| indexPattern | string | `"my-index-name"` | name of the index pattern to be mapped to the role. Can contain wildcards if not set, will reuse roleName |

## Conclusion

This Helm chart simplifies the process of setting up roles in an OpenSearch cluster. By using this chart, administrators can ensure that they have a consistent and reproducible method for configuring OpenSearch roles in their Kubernetes environments.
