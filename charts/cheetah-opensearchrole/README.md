![Version: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for creating opensearch roles with both read and write permissions based on a given index name.

## Introduction

This is to support the OAuth2 security model and helps scaffold the nessesary roles for the OpenSearch cluster that is mapped from the role claims in the JWT token.

## Role Definitions

The chart creates two OpensearchUserRoleBinding and OpensearchRole resources:

1. A OpenSearch role with read permissions (`roleName_read`).
2. A OpenSearch role with write permissions (`roleName_write`).

It translated the roleName to a indexname and optionally allows wildcard suffixes to be added to the indexname.

Each role has cluster permissions for node sniffing, health monitoring, and index and template discovery.

## Conclusion

This Helm chart simplifies the process of setting up roles in an OpenSearch cluster. By using this chart, administrators can ensure that they have a consistent and reproducible method for configuring OpenSearch roles in their Kubernetes environments.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| roleName | string | `"my-index-name"` | name of the index and the mapped role to be created |
| addSuffixWildcardToIndex | bool | `false` | Will add a * to the suffix of the index name. Valid values are true, false |
